    "text": "Research Questions:\n\nRQ-1. How does total and average medical revenue vary across different age groups, and what is the proportional contribution of each age group to the overall medical revenue?\nThe analysis shows that older age groups, particularly those aged 65 and above, contribute the most to total medical revenue, generating $409.3M, or 29.2% of the overall revenue. This is followed by the 19–35, 51–65, and 36–50 age groups, which also make significant contributions. In contrast, the 0–18 age group accounts for only $23.7M, making up just 1.7% of the total revenue.\nInterestingly, the average medical revenue per person is fairly consistent across all age groups, ranging from $25.4K to $26.7K, with the 0–18 group having a slightly higher average despite its lower total contribution. This suggests that specialized or targeted medical services for younger individuals may drive higher per-person costs.\nThe pie chart further highlights the proportional revenue contributions, with older populations, particularly those aged 65+, dominating the share. The variability in medical expenditures is also evident from the box plot, with higher costs and outliers more common in older age groups like 51–65 and 65+.\nOverall, this analysis underscores the significant impact of older populations on healthcare revenue, reflecting their higher healthcare needs. It also suggests that younger age groups, while contributing less overall, might incur higher average costs due to specialized care. These insights can guide resource allocation and healthcare planning."

Data points outside this range are considered outliers and are plotted as individual dots.\nAge Group Comparisons: By looking at the boxes and their ranges, you can compare the median medical expenditures for different age groups. If an age group has a larger interquartile range, it indicates a greater variability in medical expenses within that group.\nInterpretation for Retirement: Higher expenditures in older age groups might suggest that people in these groups are more likely to need higher medical expenses in retirement. This can imply that fewer people in these age groups will be able to fully support themselves without medical insurance or additional support post-retirement."

By analyzing patterns in age, admission types, and medication usage, we aim to provide insights that can inform cost optimization strategies, resource allocation, and improve efficiency in healthcare systems.\nResearch Questions:\nThis analysis aims to answer the following research questions:\n\nHow does total and average medical revenue vary across different age groups, and what is the proportional contribution of each age group to the overall medical revenue?\nWhat factors contribute most to higher billing amounts? Importance: Insights here can inform healthcare cost optimization and insurance claimprocesses.\n\nDataset Description:\nThis project utilizes a synthetic dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was generated using Python’s Faker library to simulate real-world healthcare records while ensuring patient privacy. It comprises 55,500 rows and 15 columns, encompassing the following key variables:\n\nPatient Demographics: Age, Gender\nClinical Details: Blood Type, Medical Condition, Medications\nAdmission and Discharge Information: Date of Admission, Discharge Date, Admission Type\nBilling and Hospital Details: Billing Amount, Hospital, Insurance Provider\nTest Results: Categorized as Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive\n\nData Cleaning Process:\nPrior to analysis, the dataset underwent a cleaning process to ensure data quality and consistency. This included:\n\nHandling Missing Values: Rows with missing values were removed from the dataset.\nData Type Conversion: Date columns (Date of Admission, Discharge Date) were converted to the appropriate date format.\nFeature Engineering: New variables were created to facilitate analysis, such as Age_Group (categorizing patients into different age ranges) and Length of Stay (calculated from admission and discharge dates).\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\nWe conducted a univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, particularly focusing on age, revenue, and billing amounts. The research questions also comes under the bivariate analysis, we have answered them beneath this column in the presentation.qmd file of the project. (Note: Brief explanation is done under the methodology part )\n\nMethodology\nThis section outlines the approaches and techniques employed in our analysis to address the research questions.\nData Preprocessing:\n\nData Cleaning: The initial step involved cleaning the raw data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This included:\n\nHandling Missing Data: Rows with any missing values were removed from the dataset to prevent inaccuracies in the analysis.\nCorrecting Data Types: The Date.of.Admission and Discharge.Date columns were converted to the correct date format to enable date-based calculations and analysis.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\nWe conducted a univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, particularly focusing on age, revenue, and billing amounts.\n\n\nUnivariate Analysis\nUnivariate analysis focuses on exploring individual variables in isolation to understand their distributions, central tendencies, and dispersions. Key visualizations include:\n\nGender Distribution: Examining the frequency and proportion of males and females in the dataset.\nDistribution of Medical Conditions: Analyzing the prevalence of various medical conditions.\nBlood Type Distribution: Exploring the distribution of different blood types among patients.\nTest Results Distribution: Investigating the frequency of different test result categories (e.g., normal, abnormal).\n\n\n\nBivariate Analysis\nBivariate analysis aims to understand the relationship between two variables, exploring potential associations or correlations. Key visualizations include:\n\nAge Group Distribution of Patients: Analyzing the number of patients within different age ranges.\nAge Distribution by Medical Condition: Examining how age varies across different medical conditions.\nAdmission Type by Medical Condition: Investigating the relationship between admission types (e.g., emergency, elective) and medical conditions.\nMedical Conditions by Blood Type: Exploring potential associations between blood types and specific medical conditions.\nYearly Revenue Summary and Validation: Analyzing yearly revenue trends to identify patterns over time.\nTotal Medical Revenue by Age Group: Examining the total revenue generated by different age groups.\nProportion of Total Revenue by Age Group: Analyzing the proportional contribution of each age group to the overall revenue.\nAverage Medical Revenue by Age Group: Investigating the average revenue generated per person within each age group.\nMedical Expenditure by Age Group: Visualizing the distribution of medical expenditures across different age groups.\nAverage Billing Amount by Admission Type: Comparing the average billing amounts for different admission types.\nComparison of Total Billing Amounts by Medication: Analyzing the total billing amounts associated with different medications.\n\nThis comprehensive EDA provides a foundation for understanding the key factors influencing medical revenue and billing amounts, which can inform decision-making for resource allocation, cost optimization, and process improvement in healthcare.\nModel Training and Evaluation:\nTo understand healthcare factors and make accurate predictions, we evaluated two machine learning models: Multinomial Regression and Random Forest. Each model’s performance sheds light on the dataset’s characteristics and the challenges in achieving better predictions.\n\nMultinomial Regression As a straightforward and interpretable approach, multinomial regression provided an accuracy of 33.54%, only marginally outperforming random guessing for a dataset with three balanced categories. Its simplicity allows for easy interpretation of linear relationships between variables, making it a useful starting point. However, its inability to capture nonlinear patterns highlighted significant gaps in the dataset’s feature quality. This outcome suggests the need for more informative predictors to better differentiate between categories. Multinomial regression serves as a baseline for comparison but falls short in addressing the complexities of the data.\nRandom Forest: Random Forest, an advanced ensemble learning method, delivered a slightly better accuracy of 34.12%. By leveraging multiple decision trees and bootstrap sampling, this model can effectively capture nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables. Additionally, its feature importance ranking provides valuable insights into which predictors most influence the outcomes. Despite these strengths, the minimal performance improvement over multinomial regression signals deeper issues, such as insufficient feature refinement or model tuning. These results underline the potential benefits of hyperparameter optimization and the inclusion of more relevant features to unlock the model’s full potential.\n\nKey Observations: The results from both models highlight critical challenges in the dataset. The limited performance of multinomial regression and the modest gains from Random Forest indicate that the current features do not fully capture the complexity of the target variable. Improved feature engineering is essential to address these issues. Strategies such as creating interaction terms, enriching the dataset with external data, or applying dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA could reveal hidden patterns and improve predictive accuracy."

The 0-18 age group has the lowest total revenue contribution.\n\nProportion of Total Revenue by Age Group:\n\n\nThis pie chart visually reinforces the dominant contribution of the 65+ age group, representing approximately 29.2% of the total revenue. The 19-35 and 51-65 age groups also hold significant proportions, highlighting the importance of these demographics in healthcare revenue generation.\n\nAverage Medical Revenue by Age Group:\n\nInterestingly, while the total revenue varies considerably across age groups, the average revenue per person remains relatively consistent, ranging from approximately $25.4K to $26.7K. This suggests that while older age groups contribute more to the overall revenue due to higher healthcare utilization, the average cost of treating an individual remains fairly stable across different age demographics.\nMedical Expenditure by Age Group\n\n\nThe box plot of Medical Expenditure by Age Group shows how medical costs vary across age groups. Each box highlights the typical range, with the median line marking the central value. Whiskers show most data, while dots represent outliers. Older age groups tend to have higher or more variable costs, emphasizing the need for medical insurance or financial planning in retirement, as many may struggle to cover these expenses independently.\n\n\nResults for Research Question 2: Factors Influencing Billing Amounts\nFactors Influencing Billing Amounts\n\nAverage Billing Amount by Admission Type:\n\n\nThe bar chart reveals that Emergency admissions have the highest average billing amount, followed by Urgent and then Elective admissions. This suggests that the complexity and urgency of care required for unplanned or critical treatments contribute significantly to higher billing amounts.\n\nComparison of Total Billing Amounts by Medication:\n\n\nThe bar chart demonstrates that certain medications, such as Ibuprofen, Lipitor, and Aspirin, have notably high total billing amounts. This indicates that these medications, likely due to their widespread usage or high individual costs, contribute substantially to overall healthcare expenditure.\nNote: The four comparisons from Research Question 1 are also relevant to understanding and addressing the factors influencing in Research Question 2.\n\nPredicting Test Results with Machine Learning\n\n\nThe bar chart above illustrates the performance of two machine learning models, Multinomial Regression and Random Forest, in predicting test results. Both models exhibit low accuracy, with the Multinomial Regression achieving 33.5% accuracy and the Random Forest slightly higher at 34.1%. This suggests that the models, in their current form, have limited predictive power for determining test outcomes based on the included features."

    "text": "Discussion\nSummary of Insights:\nOur analysis reveals key insights into medical revenue trends across age groups and factors influencing higher billing amounts. The 65+ age group emerges as the largest contributor, accounting for approximately 29.2% of total healthcare revenue, followed by the 19-35, 51-65, and 36-50 age groups. Interestingly, while total revenue varies across age groups, the average medical revenue per person remains relatively consistent. Additionally, there is an upward trend in yearly revenue, reflecting an overall rise in healthcare expenditure over time. Emergency admissions are linked to the highest average billing amounts, and specific medications, such as Ibuprofen, Lipitor, and Aspirin, significantly impact overall billing costs.\nWhy Machine Learning Accuracy is Low:\n\nMissing and incomplete data: The synthetic dataset may lack crucial information, such as socioeconomic factors or detailed medical history, which could improve model accuracy.\nLimited feature selection: The current models use a limited set of features. Including additional relevant predictors could enhance predictive performance.\nSystem limitations: System constraints restricted the complexity and fine-tuning of our models.\nImbalanced classes: The distribution of test results (normal, abnormal, inconclusive) may be imbalanced, affecting model training and accuracy."
