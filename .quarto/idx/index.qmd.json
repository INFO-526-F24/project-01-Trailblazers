By analyzing patterns in age, admission types, and medication usage, we aim to provide insights that can inform cost optimization strategies, resource allocation, and improve efficiency in healthcare systems.\n\n**Research Questions:**\n\nThis analysis aims to answer the following research questions:\n\n1.  **How does total and average medical revenue vary across different age groups, and what is the proportional contribution of each age group to the overall medical revenue?**\n2.  **What factors contribute most to higher billing amounts? Importance: Insights here can inform healthcare cost optimization and insurance claimprocesses.**\n\n### Dataset Description\n\nThis project utilizes a synthetic dataset sourced from Kaggle (\\[<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset>\\]). The dataset was generated using Python's Faker library to simulate real-world healthcare records while ensuring patient privacy. It is provided as a single CSV file with 55,500 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a patient encounter and contains information on the following key variables:\n\n-   **Patient Demographics:** Age, Gender\n-   **Clinical Details:** Blood Type, Medical Condition, Medications\n-   **Admission and Discharge Information:** Date of Admission, Discharge Date, Admission Type\n-   **Billing and Hospital Details:** Billing Amount, Hospital, Insurance Provider\n-   **Test Results:** Categorized as Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive\n\n### Data Cleaning Process\n\nPrior to analysis, the dataset underwent a cleaning process to ensure data quality and consistency. This included:\n\n-   **Handling Missing Values:** Rows with missing values were removed from the dataset.\n-   **Data Type Conversion:** The `Date.of.Admission` and `Discharge.Date` columns were converted from character format to the `YYYY-MM-DD` date format using the `ymd()` function from the `lubridate` package.\n-   **Feature Engineering:** New variables were created to facilitate analysis:\n    -   `Age_Group`: Categorizing patients into different age ranges (0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51-65, 65+).\n    -   `Length of Stay`: Calculated from admission and discharge dates.\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nWe conducted univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data, particularly focusing on age, revenue, and billing amounts. The research questions also fall under bivariate analysis; we have answered them in the `presentation.qmd` file of the project. (Note: A brief explanation is provided in the methodology section.)\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis section outlines the approaches and techniques employed in our analysis to address the research questions. We employed a mixed-methods approach combining visual exploration with statistical analysis and predictive modeling.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\n\n-   **Data Cleaning:** To ensure the quality and reliability of our analysis, we began by cleaning the raw data. This involved:\n    -   **Handling Missing Data:** Rows with any missing values were removed from the dataset to prevent inaccuracies in the analysis. This approach was chosen due to the relatively small proportion of missing data and to avoid introducing bias through imputation methods.\n    -   **Correcting Data Types:** The `Date.of.Admission` and `Discharge.Date` columns were converted from character format to the `YYYY-MM-DD` date format using the `ymd()` function from the `lubridate` package. This conversion was necessary to enable date-based calculations and analysis.\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a deeper understanding of the data and uncover patterns related to age, revenue, and billing amounts. This involved both univariate and bivariate analyses.\n\n#### Univariate Analysis\n\nUnivariate analysis was performed to explore individual variables in isolation. We utilized the following visualization techniques:\n\n-   **Histograms:** Histograms were used to visualize the distribution of numerical variables like age and billing amount, providing insights into their central tendencies, spread, and skewness.\n-   **Bar Charts:** Bar charts were employed to examine the frequency and proportion of categorical variables such as gender, medical condition, blood type, and test results. This allowed us to understand the distribution of these categorical variables and identify any potential imbalances.\n\n#### Bivariate Analysis\n\nBivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between pairs of variables. We used a variety of techniques:\n\n-   **Scatterplots:** Scatterplots were used to visualize the relationship between age and billing amount, helping us to identify any potential correlations or trends.\n-   **Grouped Bar Charts:** Grouped bar charts were employed to analyze the relationship between categorical variables like admission type and medical condition, or medical condition and blood type. This allowed us to compare frequencies and identify potential associations between these variables.\n-   **Box Plots:** Box plots were used to examine how age varies across different medical conditions, providing insights into the distribution of age within each condition and highlighting any potential outliers.\n-   **Line Graphs:** Line graphs were used to analyze yearly revenue trends to identify patterns over time, such as periods of growth or decline.\n-   **Aggregated Statistics:** We calculated aggregated statistics, such as total and average medical revenue by age group, and compared average billing amounts by admission type. This provided a quantitative understanding of the relationships between these variables.\n\n### Model Training and Evaluation\n\nTo further explore the factors influencing healthcare outcomes and to assess the predictive capabilities of different modeling approaches, we trained and evaluated two machine learning models:\n\n-   **Multinomial Regression:** Multinomial regression was selected due to its interpretability and suitability for predicting categorical outcomes with more than two classes (in this case, the `Test.Results` variable). This model allows us to understand the linear relationships between predictor variables and the outcome.\n-   **Random Forest:** Random forest was chosen for its ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, potentially leading to improved predictive performance compared to multinomial regression. This model is also less susceptible to overfitting and can handle high-dimensional data.\n\nBoth models were trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall). We acknowledge that the use of a synthetic dataset and the limited selection of features may have influenced the models' performance. Future work could explore the inclusion of additional relevant predictors and the use of more complex models to potentially improve predictive accuracy.\n\n## Results\n\nThis section presents the key findings from our analysis, utilizing visualizations to effectively communicate the insights and answer the research questions.\n\n### Results for Research Question 1: Age and Revenue\n\n**Revenue Distribution Across Age Groups**\n\n-   **Total Medical Revenue by Age Group:**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.27.53%20AM.jpeg)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The bar chart (Figure 1) illustrates that the age group of 65+ years contributes the most to the total medical revenue, followed by the 19-35, 51-65, and 36-50 age groups. The 0-18 age group has the lowest total revenue contribution.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Proportion of Total Revenue by Age Group:**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.27.53%20AM%20(2).jpeg)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   This pie chart (Figure 2) visually reinforces the dominant contribution of the 65+ age group, representing approximately 29.2% of the total revenue. The 19-35 and 51-65 age groups also hold significant proportions, highlighting the importance of these demographics in healthcare revenue generation.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Average Medical Revenue by Age Group:**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.27.54%20AM.jpeg)\n\n-   Interestingly(Figure 3), while the total revenue varies considerably across age groups, the average revenue per person remains relatively consistent, ranging from approximately \\$25.4K to \\$26.7K (Figure 3). This suggests that while older age groups contribute more to the overall revenue due to higher healthcare utilization, the average cost of treating an individual remains fairly stable across different age demographics.\n\n-   **Medical Expenditure by Age Group**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.27.53%20AM%20(1).jpeg)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The box plot (Figure 4) of Medical Expenditure by Age Group shows how medical costs vary across age groups. Each box highlights the typical range of expenditures, with the median line marking the central value. Whiskers show the majority of the data, while dots represent outliers. Older age groups tend to have higher and more variable costs, emphasizing the need for medical insurance or financial planning in retirement, as many may struggle to cover these expenses independently.\n\n### Results for Research Question 2: Factors Influencing Billing Amounts\n\n**Factors Influencing Billing Amounts**\n\n-   **Average Billing Amount by Admission Type:**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.29.10%20AM%20(1).jpeg)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The bar chart (Figure 5) reveals that Emergency admissions have the highest average billing amount, followed by Urgent and then Elective admissions. This suggests that the complexity and urgency of care required for unplanned or critical treatments contribute significantly to higher billing amounts.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   **Comparison of Total Billing Amounts by Medication:**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.29.10%20AM.jpeg){width=\"581\"}\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The bar chart (Figure 6) demonstrates that certain medications, such as Ibuprofen, Lipitor, and Aspirin, have notably high total billing amounts. This indicates that these medications, likely due to their widespread usage or high individual costs, contribute substantially to overall healthcare expenditure.\n\n**Note: The four comparisons from Research Question 1 are also relevant to understanding and addressing the factors influencing in Research Question 2.**\n\n-   **Predicting Test Results with Machine Learning**\n\n    ![](images/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-12-13%20at%2012.28.11%20AM.jpeg){width=\"593\"}\n\nThe bar chart above illustrates the performance of two machine learning models, Multinomial Regression and Random Forest, in predicting test results. Both models exhibit low accuracy, with the Multinomial Regression achieving 33.5% accuracy and the Random Forest slightly higher at 34.1%. This suggests that the models, in their current form, have limited predictive power for determining test outcomes based on the included features.\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Summary of Insights\n\nOur analysis has yielded valuable insights into medical revenue trends across age groups and the factors contributing to higher billing amounts.\n\n-   **Age and Revenue:** The 65+ age group emerged as the largest contributor to total healthcare revenue, accounting for approximately 29.2%, followed by the 19-35, 51-65, and 36-50 age groups. Interestingly, while the total revenue varies across age groups, the average medical revenue per person remains relatively consistent. This suggests that healthcare utilization increases with age, but the average cost of treating an individual remains fairly stable across age demographics.\n\n-   **Yearly Revenue Trend:** The observed upward trend in yearly revenue indicates an overall rise in healthcare expenditure over time. This trend may be attributed to factors such as inflation, advancements in medical technology, and an aging population.\n\n-   **Admission Type and Billing:** Emergency admissions are associated with the highest average billing amounts, followed by Urgent and then Elective admissions. This highlights the increased cost associated with unplanned or critical treatments, likely due to the intensity and complexity of care required.\n\n-   **Medications and Billing:** Certain medications, such as Ibuprofen, Lipitor, and Aspirin, have significantly high total billing amounts. This suggests that these medications, potentially due to their widespread usage or high individual costs, contribute substantially to overall healthcare expenditure.\n\n-   **Machine Learning Models:** The relatively low accuracy of our machine learning models (Multinomial Regression: 33.5%, Random Forest: 34.1%) indicates that the current set of features may not fully capture the complexity of predicting test outcomes.\n\n### Implications of Findings\n\nThese findings have important implications for various stakeholders in the healthcare sector:\n\n-   **Healthcare Providers:** Understanding the revenue distribution across age groups can help providers optimize resource allocation and tailor services to meet the specific needs of different patient demographics. For example, investing in preventive care and chronic disease management for older age groups could lead to better health outcomes and potentially reduce healthcare costs in the long run.\n\n-   **Insurance Companies:** The insights into factors driving higher billing amounts can inform insurance pricing strategies and claims processing. By understanding the cost variations associated with different admission types and medications, insurers can develop more accurate risk assessment models and ensure appropriate coverage for policyholders.\n\n-   **Policymakers:** The findings can inform healthcare policy decisions related to cost containment and resource allocation. For example, policies aimed at promoting preventive care and reducing unnecessary emergency room visits could help to control healthcare spending.\n\n### Limitations of the Analysis\n\nWhile our analysis provides valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge its limitations:\n\n-   **Synthetic Dataset:** Our analysis is based on a synthetic dataset, which may not perfectly capture the nuances and complexities of real-world healthcare data. Generalizing the findings to real-world scenarios should be done with caution.\n\n-   **Limited Feature Selection:** The machine learning models were trained on a limited set of features. Including additional relevant predictors, such as socioeconomic factors, detailed medical history, and lifestyle information, could potentially improve model accuracy.\n\n-   **System Constraints:** System limitations restricted the complexity and fine-tuning of our machine learning models. With greater computational resources, more sophisticated models and hyperparameter tuning techniques could be explored.\n\n### Future Work\n\nTo build upon our findings and address the limitations, we propose the following directions for future work:\n\n-   **Validate with Real-world Data:** Validate the findings using real-world healthcare data to assess the generalizability of the observed patterns and relationships.\n\n-   **Incorporate Additional Variables:** Include a wider range of variables in the analysis, such as socioeconomic factors, detailed medical history, and lifestyle information, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of healthcare service demands.\n\n-   **Enhance Predictive Modeling:** Develop more robust predictive models by incorporating additional features, addressing class imbalance, and employing more sophisticated modeling techniques.\n\n-   **Conduct Comparative Analysis:** Perform a comparative analysis across different healthcare systems or regions to identify variations in healthcare expenditure patterns and best practices.\n\nBy addressing these limitations and pursuing future research directions, we can further enhance our understanding of healthcare service demands and contribute to more effective and efficient healthcare systems.\n\n## References\n\n-   Healthcare Dataset.
