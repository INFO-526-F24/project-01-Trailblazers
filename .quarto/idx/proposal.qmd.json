Age Groups: Older age groups are more likely to have \"Abnormal\" test results due to comorbidities, whereas younger demographics might show a higher rate of \"Normal\" outcomes.\n\n2.  Gender Influence: Certain medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases or diabetes) and test results may differ significantly between genders.\n\n3.  Condition-Specific Outcomes: Patients with chronic conditions like hypertension or diabetes may exhibit a higher proportion of \"Abnormal\" results, while those admitted for minor ailments may lean toward \"Normal\" outcomes.\n\n4.  Admission Type Correlation: Emergency admissions are hypothesized to show a higher likelihood of \"Abnormal\" results compared to elective or urgent admissions due to the critical nature of emergency cases.\n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n\n1.  Identification of high-risk demographic groups (e.g., older males with diabetes) for targeted interventions.\n\n2.  Insights into resource allocation based on the likelihood of \"Abnormal\" or \"Inconclusive\" results in specific demographics.\n\n3.  Improved predictive models for healthcare outcomes that incorporate demographic data, aiding in precision medicine and operational efficiency.\n\n### Importance of This Study:\n\nPersonalized Medicine: Tailored interventions based on identified demographic patterns can enhance patient care.\n\nHealthcare Efficiency: Understanding the links between demographics and test results can help hospitals optimize diagnostic resources.\n\nPolicy Making: The insights can inform public health policies, focusing on vulnerable populations for better health outcomes.\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n1.  Data Preprocessing:\n\nHandle categorical data by encoding variables like Gender, Medical Condition, Admission Type, and Test Results. Convert date columns (e.g., Date of Admission and Discharge Date) into appropriate formats and calculate the length of stay.\n\n2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nVisualize the distribution of Test Results across different demographics and medical conditions. Identify correlations between numerical features like Age, Billing Amount, and Room Number.\n\n3.  Feature Engineering:\n\nCreate additional features, such as length of hospital stay and admission seasonality.\n\n4.  Modeling:\n\nFrame this as a multiclass classification problem to predict Test Results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive). Use algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\n5.  Insights and Recommendations:\n\nSummarize key factors influencing test results. Provide actionable insights for improving healthcare analytics and decision-making.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-pkgs\n#| message: false\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n## Dataset\n\n```{r}\n#| label: load-dataset\n#| message: false\n\ndata <- read.csv(here(\"data\", \"healthcare_dataset.csv\"))\n\nglimpse(data)\n\n\n\n```\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.\n\n## Source:\n\nKaggle\n\n## How it was originally collected:\n\nThis dataset was synthetically generated using Python's Faker library.
