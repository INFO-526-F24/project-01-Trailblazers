## Abstract

This study explores how patient demographics, such as age and gender, along with medical conditions, impact diagnostic test results. By examining these relationships, it aims to identify patterns that can enhance healthcare decision-making and ensure resources are directed where theyâ€™re needed most. The insights can help healthcare providers improve diagnostic accuracy, deliver tailored care, and address disparities in outcomes. This research contributes to advancing patient-centered healthcare, making it more precise, accessible, and equitable, ultimately supporting a future where medical decisions are better informed by individual patient profiles and real-world needs..
