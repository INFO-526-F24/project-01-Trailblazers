Insights from such research help identify patterns and disparities that influence diagnostic accuracy, enabling healthcare providers to deliver personalized care tailored to individual needs. This understanding also facilitates better resource allocation, ensuring critical care reaches high-risk populations effectively. Moreover, it enhances predictive modeling for early intervention, supports data-driven decision-making, and guides public health policies to address systemic inequities. By focusing on these relationships, the study contributes to the development of more efficient, equitable, and patient-centered healthcare systems."

Convert date columns (e.g., Date of Admission and Discharge Date) into appropriate formats and calculate the length of stay.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n\nVisualize the distribution of Test Results across different demographics and medical conditions. Identify correlations between numerical features like Age, Billing Amount, and Room Number.\n\nFeature Engineering:\n\nCreate additional features, such as length of hospital stay and admission seasonality.\n\nModeling:\n\nFrame this as a multiclass classification problem to predict Test Results (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive). Use algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\nInsights and Recommendations:\n\nSummarize key factors influencing test results.
